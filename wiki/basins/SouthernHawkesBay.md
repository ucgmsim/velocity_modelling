## Notes
- (Comment from the author) "Will be near the Wairarapa and Manawatu-Whanganui / Taranaki basins, but does not physically touch due to rock."
- (Comment from the author) "Physically connects to Northern Hawkes Bay in the Ngaruroro River valley. Need to check consistency in the bedrock surfaces at the intersection."
- Missing some parts in the east coast.
